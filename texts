Single Shot Multibox Detector with KAN 
Motivation

Recently, KAN(Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem
has came out which is an alternatives to MLP(Multi-Layer Perceptrons) and it outperform MLPs 
in terms of accuracy and interpretability in some tasks.

More and more kinds of KAN-based networks has been implemented such as Convolutional KAN, ViT-KAN.

SSD(Single Shot Multibox Detection) is a good one-stage object-detection method with many Conv2D layers,
which can be replaced by KAN-Conv to test whether KAN will perform similar or better.

Dataset and Features

Raw Data:
32x32 1 channel pictures with 80%  random Mnist numbers, randomly scaled width and height from 15 to 28.
